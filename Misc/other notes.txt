=================== Programming throwdown ep41 Node.js ==========================


You can think of Node JS as a command line javascript engine. It can basically make you run JS not on your browser.

2008 Google released V8 js engine. They want you to use that to run js inside chrome. 
2009 Node JS came out. 

JS run on command line in V8, but it does not run on OS. 

In JS everything is either a dictionary or an array or a primitive (like a string or a number).
That maps really well with Json. You can see Json as a serialised form of javascript object. 

You can write js in the broswer and turns objects into strings and send it to the server. ANd the server is running node.js.
And it can turn those strings back to object. 

It is specially useful when it comes to validation. 

You write the validation code in js and you know it can be used on client side (the browser) as well as the server side.
